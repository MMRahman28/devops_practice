	- Verifying primary group: `id jack` (shows UID, GID and secondary groups) 
	- View all groups in the system: `cat /etc/group`
	- View or verify a specific group: `cat /etc/group | grep -E "group_name"` or, `getent group group_name`
	- Create a new group: `sudo groupadd group_name`
	- Add user to this group: `sudo usermod -aG group_name jack` (secondary group. -a stands for append)
	- Add user to a primary group: `sudo usermod -g primary_group_name jack`
	- One line code to adduser and select a primary group for the user: `sudo adduser --group group_name user_name` (prerequisite: group_name exists)

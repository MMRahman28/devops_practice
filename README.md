## Live Project: Log Monitoring System

- **Build a log monitor bash script**:
	- Email alert added, now a real-time log monitoring system
	- Cron job added to send email alert every 5 minutes
	- Scripts: `log_monitor.sh`

	```bash
	./log_monitor.sh /var/log/syslog ERROR
	```
- **Automated Backup**
	- `tar -czf` with timestamp
	- safe checks => `[[ -d ]]`, `mkdir -p`
	- Clean output with `2>/dev/null`
	
	`./backup.sh`

- **System Health Monitor**
	- Checks disk, memory, load
	- Email alerts via msmtp
	- Cron every 15 min

    `./health_check.sh`

- **Log Rotation**
	- Prevents disk full, keeps recent data
	- find /path -type f -name "*.tar.gz" -mtime +7 -print0
	- `-print0` use null separator,`xargs -0` handles null separated input
	- Use `-print0` with `xargs -0` -> safe

	`rotates_logs.sh`

- **Monitor Service**
	- sleep-walking-service is being used to test monitor_service.sh
	- Auto restart
	- `pkill -f` to stop

	`monitor_service.sh`

- **Parse Configuration**

	- `declare -A` = associative array
	- `IFS='='` + with `read -r` get key value
	- `xargs` trim whitespace
	- `IFS=','` `read -ra` split list and put them in an array
	- With regex skip comment (#) and empty lines

	`parse_config.sh` , `app.conf`


## Today's Progress (23 December, 2025)

- **Resource Monitoring**

    - Cpu time usage for ls: `time ls`
	- load time avg is the avg number of processes currently ready to run
	- `uptime` shows load time avg past 1 min, 5 mins, and 15 mins respectively.
	- Kernel assists the MMU by breaking down memory into pages.
	- Two page faults: minor and major
	- ps, top and time commands can show these page faults
	- Useful commands to see overall performance: vmstat, iostat, iotop, pidstat
	- Control groups: version 1 and version 2.
	- Version 1: Each controllers form one controller group, a process can belong to multiple control groups.
	- Version 2: A group can have both memory and cpu controllers. A process can belong in only one cgroup.

## Live Project: Log Monitoring System
- **Build a log monitor bash script**:
	- Email alert added, now a real-time log monitoring system
	- Cron job added to send email alert every 5 minutes
	- Scripts: `log_monitor.sh`

	```bash
	./log_monitor.sh /var/log/syslog ERROR
	```


## Today's Progress (3 November, 2025)
- **Backup script with timestamp, tar and safety**:
	- Safe use of [[ ]] instead of [ ]
	- exit status, capturing a command's exit status with `$?`
	- Scripts: `backup.sh`
	- **Github**: Daily commit + `notes.md` updated

## Live Project: Log Monitoring System

- **Build a log monitor bash script**:
	- Email alert added, now a real-time log monitoring system
	- Cron job added to send email alert every 5 minutes
	- Scripts: `log_monitor.sh`

	```bash
	./log_monitor.sh /var/log/syslog ERROR
	```
- **Automated Backup**
	- `tar -czf` with timestamp
	- safe checks => `[[ -d ]]`, `mkdir -p`
	- Clean output with `2>/dev/null`
	
	`./backup.sh`

- **System Health Monitor**
	- Checks disk, memory, load
	- Email alerts via msmtp
	- Cron every 15 min

    `./health_check.sh`

- **Log Rotation**
	- Prevents disk full, keeps recent data
	- find /path -type f -name "*.tar.gz" -mtime +7 -print0
	- `-print0` use null separator,`xargs -0` handles null separated input
	- Use `-print0` with `xargs -0` -> safe

	`rotates_logs.sh`

- **Monitor Service**
	- sleep-walking-service is being used to test monitor_service.sh
	- Auto restart
	- `pkill -f` to stop

	`monitor_service.sh`

- **Parse Configuration**

	- `declare -A` = associative array
	- `IFS='='` + with `read -r` get key value
	- `xargs` trim whitespace
	- `IFS=','` `read -ra` split list and put them in an array
	- With regex skip comment (#) and empty lines

	`parse_config.sh` , `app.conf`


## Today's Progress (24 January, 2026)

- **Unix and Linux System Admin Handbook Chapter 15 - IP Routing part 1**

	- Routing protocols are better than static routing systems for a complex network.
	- Two general types of routing protocols: distance-vector and link-state
	- RIP is a DV protocol, OSPF is a link-state protocol.
	- Cost metrics: fewer hops? path with the lowest latency? lowest cost? Largest internal minimal bandwidth? 
	- EIGRP and OSPF are equally good. RIP is older but RIPv2 is still in use and handy. RIPng for IPv6.
	- BGP is an external routing protocol for managing traffic among autonomous subsystems. Now, used for internet backbone routing.
